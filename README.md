<img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-xoblite-net.png" width="33%" height="33%"><br>_A personal project to create [HomeKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/) accessories, for fun and non-profit.<br>I started working on [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) accessory plugins a few months back and will be uploading stuff here continuously.<br>This readme is still a work-in-progress, however the code itself should hopefully be somewhat self-explainable as well...  :wink:
<br>All applications have been tested on [Raspberry Pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) running [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and [Node.js 8.x](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/), but are provided “AS IS”._

| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-ds18b20.png" width="33%" height="33%"> <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-ds18b20-outdoors.png" width="33%" height="33%"> | **DS18B20_accessory.js**<br>Straightforward integration of the ubiquitous [DS18B20](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/DS18B20.html) digital (12-bit) temperature sensor. This plugin can support two sensor devices - typically placed indoors and outdoors respectively - simultaneously per instance. Just [enable 1-Wire](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/1_wire) and enter your sensor ID(s) into the .js, and you should be good to go. Simple, [cheap](https://www.kjell.com/se/sortiment/el-verktyg/arduino/tillbehor/luxorparts-temperatursensor-med-kabel-for-arduino-p87893), [reasonably accurate](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf) (±0.5°C over much of the range) and [optionally waterproofed](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=DS18B20) - what more can you ask for? :smile:|
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-supersnap.png" width="100%" height="100%"> | **SuperSnap_accessory.js**<br>A multi-purpose tool to deliver snapshot photos and/or images via the HomeKit camera interface. Building off a merge and modification of the original HAP-NodeJS camera accessory code, this plugin provides integration with the [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) (nb. snapshots only, no video streaming) as well as to "random image" services like [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/), [LoremFlickr](https://loremflickr.com/) and [PlaceIMG](https://placeimg.com/) for various testing purposes. More information to be added here later. |
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-unicorn-phat.png" width="33%" height="33%"> | **Unicorn_pHAT_accessory.js**<br>Regular light, but also a CPU Load+History meter, Fire, Swirl and Rainbow summoner, Mood indicator, and more! That is, quite advanced HomeKit integration for the [Pimoroni Unicorn pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-phat) for [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). Uses the [rpi-ws281x-native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rpi-ws281x-native) module to control the Unicorn pHAT, and [needs to run as root](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rpi-ws281x-native#needs-to-run-as-root) since this in turn needs to configure e.g. DMA and PWM to do this. More information will be added here later. <br><br>_Hint: Brightness selects display mode: 1 CPU Load. 2 CPU History. 3 Fire. 4 Swirl. 5 Rainbow. 9 (subject to change) Icons. >10 Regular Light. For now... :wink:_ |
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-zero-cpu.png" width="33%" height="33%"> <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-zero-temp.png" width="33%" height="33%"> | **Pi_Zero_CPU_statistics_accessory.js**<br>CPU Load Meter (via a spoofed humidity sensor showing the non-idle 3 second average load in %) and Temperature Sensor. Reads the current values periodically (with adaptive frequency) from the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) and reports it back to HomeKit. It also supports optional exposure to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (on port 9999 by default), and can thereby easily also be monitored beautifully by [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (based on exposed metrics such as _raspberry_pi_zero_cpu_load_non_idle_, _raspberry_pi_zero_cpu_temperature_, and a few others). |
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-keba-p30.png" width="33%" height="33%"> | **KEBA_P30_accessory.js**<br>High level integration of the [KEBA KeContact P30 series](https://www.keba.com/en/emobility/products/product-overview/product_overview) wallbox charging stations for electric cars (via a spoofed fan accessory showing the charging/plugged state as well as the power output in percentage of the HW/SW configured maximum). Reads the current values periodically (10 seconds interleaving) from the wallbox using its [UDP based API](https://www.keba.com/en/emobility/service-support/downloads/Downloads) (note that your wallbox IP address must be configured on line 11), and reports back to HomeKit. It also supports optional exposure of these and other parameters to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (on port 11521, cf. K=11, E=5, B=2, A=1, by default), see above. |
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-ping-presence.png" width="33%" height="33%"> | **PING_Presence_accessory.js**<br>Want to know if Elvis is in the building? Sure thing: This is a simple presence monitoring plugin, based on [PING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)); quite usable but with some non-avoidable caveats due to things like device sleep modes etc. More information will be added here later. | 
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-sounds-like-home.png" width="33%" height="33%"> | **Coming soon...** :sweat_smile: |

Enjoy! :sunglasses:
