# HAP-NodeJS-accessories

Started working on [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) accessories a few weeks back; will upload the first public ones here shortly.

**Pi_Zero_CPU_temperature_accessory.js**
<br>Temperature sensor. Reads the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) CPU temperature periodically (with adaptive frequency) and reports in back to HomeKit.

**Unicorn_pHAT_accessory.js**
<br>Advanced HomeKit integration for the [Pimoroni Unicorn pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-phat) for [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). More information will be added here later.

Have fun!
