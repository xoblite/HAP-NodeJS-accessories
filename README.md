# xoblite/HAP-NodeJS-accessories

_I started working on [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) accessory plugins a few months back and will be uploading stuff here continuously.<br>This readme is still a work-in-progress, however the code itself should hopefully be somewhat self-explainable as well...  :wink:_

| Icon ======================== | Description =================================================== |
| :----------: | :---------- |
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-supersnap.png" width="100%" height="100%"> | **SuperSnap_accessory.js**:<br>A multi-purpose tool to deliver snapshot photos and/or images via the HomeKit camera interface. Building off a merge and modification of the original HAP-NodeJS camera accessory code, this plugin provides integration with the [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) as well as to "random image" services like [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos/), [LoremFlickr](https://loremflickr.com/) and [PlaceIMG](https://placeimg.com/) for various testing purposes. More information to be added here later. |
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-unicorn-phat.png" width="33%" height="33%"> | **Unicorn_pHAT_accessory.js**:<br>Regular light, but also a CPU load+history meter, Fire, Swirl and Rainbow summoner, Mood indicator, and more! That is, quite advanced HomeKit integration for the [Pimoroni Unicorn pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-phat) for [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). Uses the [rpi-ws281x-native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rpi-ws281x-native) module to control the Unicorn pHAT, and [needs to run as root](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rpi-ws281x-native#needs-to-run-as-root) since this in turn needs to configure e.g. DMA and PWM to do this. More information will be added here later. <br><br>_Hint: Brightness selects display mode: 1 CPU Load. 2 CPU History. 3 Fire. 4 Swirl. 5 Rainbow. 9 (subject to change) Icons. >10 Regular Light. For now... :wink:_ |

Reads the current values periodically (with adaptive frequency) from the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) and reports it back to HomeKit. It also supports optional exposure to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (on port 9999 by default), and can thereby easily also be monitored beautifully by [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (based on exposed metrics such as _raspberry_pi_zero_cpu_load_non_idle_, _raspberry_pi_zero_cpu_temperature_, and a few others). |
| <img src="http://xoblite.net/images/homekit-plugin-keba-p30.png" width="33%" height="33%"> | **KEBA_P30_accessory.js**:<br>High level integration of the [KEBA KeContact P30 series](https://www.keba.com/en/emobility/products/product-overview/product_overview) wallbox charging stations for electric cars (via a spoofed fan accessory showing the charging/plugged state as well as the power output in percentage of the HW/SW configured maximum). Reads the current values periodically (10 seconds interleaving) from the wallbox using its [UDP based API](https://www.keba.com/en/emobility/service-support/downloads/Downloads) (note that your wallbox IP address must be configured on line 11), and reports back to HomeKit. It also supports optional exposure of these and other parameters to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (on port 11521, cf. K=11, E=5, B=2, A=1, by default), see above. |

Enjoy! :sunglasses:
