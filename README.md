# HAP-NodeJS-accessories

Started working on [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) accessories a few weeks back; will upload the first public ones here shortly.

**Pi_Zero_CPU_temperature_accessory.js**
<br>Temperature sensor. Reads the Raspberry Pi Zero CPU temperature periodically (adaptive frequency) and reports in back to HomeKit.

**Unicorn_pHAT_accessory.js**
<br>Advanced HomeKit integration for the Pimoroni Unicorn pHAT for Raspberry Pi Zero. More information will be added here later.

Have fun!
