# xoblite/HAP-NodeJS-accessories

_(Nb. I started working on [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) accessory plugins a few weeks back and will start uploading the first public ones here shortly. This readme will be continuously updated, however the code itself should hopefully be somewhat self-explainable... ;) )_

**Unicorn_pHAT_accessory.js**
<br>Regular light, but also a CPU load sensor, Rainbow and Fire summoner, Mood indicator, and more! That is, quite advanced HomeKit integration for the [Pimoroni Unicorn pHAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-phat) for [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/). More information will be added here later... :)

**Pi_Zero_CPU_temperature_accessory.js**
<br>Temperature sensor. Reads the [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) CPU temperature periodically (with adaptive frequency) and reports it back to HomeKit.

Enjoy! :D
